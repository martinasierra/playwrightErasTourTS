## :dart: About ##

I started this project to practice my Playwright skills.\
I chose this website to automate because:
- It is real, not a demo or specifically created to learn.
- It is in English.
- Simple but also fun.
- I liked the correlation between Typescript --> TS and Taylor Swift --> TS ðŸ˜¸

I hope you like it ðŸ«¶
